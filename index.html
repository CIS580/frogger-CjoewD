          Rules:
          <br />&nbsp&nbsp  1. Cross the rivers and roads to get to the other side.
          <br />&nbsp&nbsp  2. Don't let the cars hit you.
          <br />&nbsp&nbsp  3. Make sure to use the logs to cross rivers! (Becareful, sometimes they sink to resurface later!)
          <br /><br />
          There are a total of 5 levels, each of which increase the river flow speed and speed limit on the roads.

          You have three lives, good luck!
